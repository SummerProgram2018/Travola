# Git Commit Guide
## Title
Make the title something that generalises the bulk of the work that you have done. So if you have implemented a UI element as well as made a minor change to the README, your title should be something like *"UI Element Implemented"*.

## Commit Message
Be concise and specific about what you have done. The following headings are a good way to organise the changes made:
* **Added**: A list of the new features that you have implemented entirely.
* **Updated**: A list of in-progress features that you have changed / modified and are closer to being completed.
* **Issues**: Specify any known bugs or issues that you have encountered. Please also create a new Issue in the GitHub repo.
## Example Commit
Let's say I added the Signup UI, made some progress on the OJP, but found a bug in the HeatMap. My commit message would be along the lines of:
~~~

          - Addition 2
